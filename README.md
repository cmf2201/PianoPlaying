# PianoPlaying

The purpose of this project is to create a awesome wall-mounted acryclic piano that lights up with the keys on a corrisponding MIDI file.
This project is the culmination of about 6+ months of work over the course of two terms at WPI working on what I beleive to be a really cool wall mount.
Feel free to use any code that is found in here, and if you would like to see more about this project, a link to a google doc containing (pretty much) everything 
about it can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LG2Ymoj-W-rWLzgENrooxNST4R7nWNM3?usp=sharing

<b>Libraries in Use</b>

- MD_MIDIFile:
This incredibly helpful library basially does most of the heavy lifting when it comes to actually reading and interpreting the midi files. 10/10 would clone again
- FastLED:
Relies on FastLED for the actual displat of each of the LEDS.
